					<p>Echinacea, commonly called Coneflower, has been known for its beneficial healing properties for well over half a decade or more. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory components make it the perfect choice for those looking to provide a boost to the immune system.</p>
<p><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>It has powerful antibacterial effects and a high concentration of vitamin C which may assist in decreasing the recovery time for the common cold. It's known for its abilities to improve healing time following extended illness or injury</p>
<p>Echinacea is praised for its detoxification effects. It has been shown to help improve liver function, which is in part because of its ability to reduce toxins throughout the body. This in turn allows the liver to function at the efficiency it was meant to.</p>
<p>When choosing an Echinacea product or blend, it is best to find an organic product. This helps to ensure the quality of the leaf and package handling. This is a popular flower among gardeners and is relatively simple to grown and harvest, with just a handful of leaves being necessary per cup of brewed tea. </p>
