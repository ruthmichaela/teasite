					<p>Peppermint tea has a number of positive qualities including the ability to reduce inflammation, increase blood flow, improve digestion, and awaken the senses. Peppermint tea can be enjoyed on its own or combined with spearmint for an even brighter experience.</p>
<p><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>This herbal tea is beneficial during all seasons of the year. In cold weather and flu season it helps to open the sinuses, reduce inflammation, and create a warming sensation throughout the body. Because of its cooling properties, it could be useful in reducing your internal body temperature during a fever.</p>
<p>It can act as a muscle relaxant, making it a great choice for an evening brew, by preparing your body and mind for quiet rest.</p>
<p>Peppermint assist aiding bile flow which aids in improving digestion. It relieves nausea and reduces inflammatory pain associated with excess gas, bloating, and digestive impairment.</p>
<p>When choosing a Peppermint or blended tea, avoid teas that are not grown organically as the delicate leaves tend to hold chemical and other harmful properties which reduces the positive effect the tea can provide. Mint is simple to grow (and can often become invasive if allowed), providing you with the best option for a rich experience.</p>
