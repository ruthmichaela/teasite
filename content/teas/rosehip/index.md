Rosehips have been used for centuries as an herbal medicinal. Deeply rich in antioxidants, specifically Vitamin C and Flavanoids, this powerful little red bud packs a powerful punch. Because of the rich nature of antioxidants in this herb, it is known to prevent oxidation, which is one of the key causes of heart disease, arthritis, and cancer.

Frequent users of Rosehip tea or tinctures note improved skin health with a reduction in blemishes and signs of premature aging. Rosehip tea touts a high concentration of Vitamin C which we all know to be a strong source of immunity power. A cup a day helps keep this vital vitamin in your system, especially when the spread of illness is at its peak (such as flu season).

Rosehip comes from the bud remaining after the beautiful petals have fallen from the flower. The Dog Rose is purported to have the highest concetration of beneficial properties.

The flavor is tart and tangy, similar to unsweetened cranberry juice. Adding honey or agave is a good way to balance the tart and tangy for enjoyable sipping. Avoid using boling water when preparing as it destroys the Vitamin C properties. An infusion is the preferred method for preserving the benefits of this lovely herb.
